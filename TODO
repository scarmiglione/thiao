Code improvements:
------------------

Use xmlrpc-c for creating and destroying the virtual machines instead of the
execution of the program through a system call.
*Resume.cpp
*Suspend.cpp



Missing code:
-------------

The following functions and variables are necessary in order to make Thiao
configurable, but not necessary for the local (current) testing mode:

struct configuration{...}
It could be a class too, a place to store the configuration parameters that
currently are either hardcoded or as part of a .h file

void config_parser(void):
Should search for the configuration file thiao.cfg in /etc and /opt/thiao at
and fill the struct/class configuration

RPC information
Add a configuration parameter for
*server url
*port
